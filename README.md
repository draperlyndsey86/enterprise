## Overview

This repo contains instructions on setting up Pull Reminders on-premises for integration with GitHub Enterprise.

1. [Choose a host](#choose-a-host)
2. [Create a Slack App](#create-a-slack-app)
3. [Create a GitHub App](#create-a-github-app)
4. [Setup Pull Reminders](#setup-pull-reminders)

## Choose a host

Pull Reminders requires a Postres database and a host to run a Docker container containing the application server. For optimal performance, your server host should have at least 2 GB RAM and your Postgres database should be run separately (ie. AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL) with at least 2 GB RAM and 10 GB storage.

Pull Reminders needs to run within the same security context as your GHE instance so that it can send and receive requests from your GitHub Enterprise instance. Pull Reminders integrates with GHE as a [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.13/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps) which means that permissions and access are granted by admin users when installing the app to GitHub organizations. Pull Reminders requires read access to pull request metadata but does not require any read or write access to code. You should also know that your Pull Reminders instance never makes requests back to our servers and your data never leaves your network other than API requests to Slack. 

## Create a Slack App

Pull Reminders requires a Slack app in order to post messages. Follow the steps below to create a Slack app for your instance of Pull Reminders.

1. Create a Slack app by going to https://api.slack.com/apps and clicking "Create New App"
2. Name the app "Pull Reminders" and set the "Development Slack Workspace" to your team's workspace
3. Set the app icon to the [image provided in this repo](./icon.png)
4. Next, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" tab and select the following scopes:
    
    ```
    channels:read
    chat:write:bot
    groups:read
    bot
    identity.basic
    identity.email
    identity.team
    users.profile:read
    team:read
    ```

5. Under the same "OAuth & Permissions" tab, add a new Redirect URI. It should be your hostname plus the path `/auth/slack/callback`, e.g. `https://pullreminders.myco.com/auth/slack/callback`. If you don't know your hostname yet, remember to come back and set this later.
6. Go to the "Bot Users" tab and create a bot user with the name "Pull Reminders" and username "pullreminders".
7. After setting up your Slack app, **do not** install the app to your Slack workspace from Slack's website. You will install the Slack App to your workspace through Pull Reminders once your instance is set up.

## Create a GitHub App

Pull Reminders requires a GitHub app in order to integrate with your GitHub Enterprise instance. Follow the steps below to create a GitHub App. You'll also come back later to make a few more updates after setting up your Pull Reminders instance.

1. Go to your GitHub "Settings" then "Developer Settings" then "GitHub Apps", then click "New GitHub App"
2. Set the fields, permissions, and event subscriptions outlined below. You can always change these later after saving. Note that several of these settings include your Pull Reminders instance hostname, so if you don't know it yet be sure to come back later and update your settings.
    
    Fields:
    
    ```
    GitHub App name:      Pull Reminders
    User auth callback:   http://pullreminders.myhost.com/auth/github/callback
    Setup URL:            http://pullreminders.myhost.com/installs
    Webhook URL:          http://pullreminders.myhost.com/webhooks/github
    ```
    
    Permissions:

    ```
    Issues:               Read-only
    Repository metadata:  Read-only
    Pull requests:        Read-only
    Organization members: Read-only
    ```
    
    Subscribe to events (note â€“ the `Member`option is not available for earlier versions of GitHub Enterprise):
    
    ```
    Issue Comment
    Issues
    Pull request
    Pull request review
    Pull request review comment
    Member
    Membership
    Organization
    ```
    
3. After saving your GitHub App, set your app icon to the [image provided in this repo](./icon.png) and generate a private key. You should also see OAuth credentials and your app ID. You'll use this information along with your private key in the next section.
4. **IMPORTANT:** Go to the "Advanced" tab and click the "Make public" button at the bottom. This allows Pull Reminders to be used and installed by all users of your GitHub Enterprise instance.
5. Though not required, it is recommended that you transfer ownership of the GitHub App to a superuser or organization so that the app isn't deleted if your individual GitHub account is deactivated. To do this, go under the "Advanced" tab and click the "Transfer ownership" button at the bottom.

## Setup Pull Reminders

1. Make sure your server host has Docker installed
2. Download the Pull Reminders docker image
3. Import it using `docker load -i pullreminders.latest.tar`
4. Create a working directory on your host `mkdir ~/pullreminders`
5. Inside this directory, create a `dockerenv` file with the variables set below. Check out a full [example dockerenv file](./dockerenv.example). `DATABASE_URL` is your Postgres connection url.

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=
    APP_HOST=
    SLACK_CLIENT_ID=
    SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=
    GITHUB_URL=
    GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT=
    GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_VERSION=
    GITHUB_APP_URL=
    GITHUB_APP_ID=
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
    GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=
    ```
    
    Due to limitations in Docker's [parsing of multi-line environment variables](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/12997), you need to replace all newlines in GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY with `\n` so it is a single line like this:

    ```
    GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEogIBA...
    ```

6. Start the container with your `dockerenv` file:

    ```
    docker run -rm -p 80:3000 --env-file ./dockerenv -d pullreminders
    ```
    
7. View logs:

    ```
    # Server logs
    docker exec <cid> tail log/production.log -f
  
    # Worker process logs
    docker exec <cid> tail log/sidekiq.log -f
    ```
